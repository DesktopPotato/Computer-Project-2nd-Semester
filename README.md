TITLE: CURRENCY CONVERTER


Objectives: To convert value in one currency into another currency, and to be able to make, remove, or modify custom currencies, allowing the user to convert amounts from those currencies.



Description in points:
•	The user will be able to insert a monetary amount in one currency and receive the equivalent amount in another currency.
•	Several currencies are planned to be supported.
•	The user can also dynamically add, remove or modify currencies, meaning that they could even have their own custom currencies and convert from/to those custom currencies.
•	The currencies are planned to be implemented through structures, along with the ability to modify collection of currencies by the usage of linked lists.

Current Status of Implementation:

The core of the program (conversion function) is complete. The user first needs to input the currency that he/she wants to convert from, and then input the currency that he/she needs to convert to. Then, the user needs to input the amount of money to be converted. The program will then output out the final amount. Major currencies like USD, INR, etc are already defined.
